Badges
---------------------------
This is an LTI-enabled service that allows you to award badges
(Mozilla Open Badges, specifically) to students in a course
based on their accomplishments in the course. Currently this
will will only work with Canvas.

Right now this is mostly a proof of concept, so there are some 
limiting assumptions:

- only one badge per course will work correctly
- trying to load/edit/manage multiple badges from multiple courses at the same time will not work
