Feed The LTI
---------------------------
This is an LTI-enabled service that allows you to 
specify RSS and Atom feeds that will be aggregated
within a launched context. Feeds can be added by
instructors, or optionally by students.

In the future, this will also allow students to 
track their personal blog feeds and turn in homework
directly from those feeds.
